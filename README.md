This repository consists of small projects programmed in JAVA.
The java files exit in: src/edu/nyu/cs/dla9511
Lastly, from A4 and onwards, all the class files in the bin/edu/nyu/cs/dla9511 must be compiled at the same time for the program to compile correctly.

Descriptions:
A1: various small projects.
A2: a program that lets you play Blackjack, and a program that prints out all prime numbers between 2 input nums from the user.
A3: a program that asks the user for any verbal 'tics' and reports data such as the frequency, from any given text file.
A4: a program that reverses a String or Number, and a program that returns the first unique Character.
A5: Building a virtual moped that travels across Manhattan (0-10th av, 0-100th st).
A6: Practice inheriting classes with Triangle attributes, UML diagrams, exception handling.
A7: implementing interfaces.
A8: Sodoku Validator: input a 9x9 grid of numbers, validate whether it's a valid sodoku solution.
